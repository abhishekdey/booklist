What is  HOC?  HOC are react functions  that take input as components return the new component. It's called react compositional nature.
controlled component: A component controls the input element within the form on subsequent user input. 
Each state mutation having associated handler function.

redux component: Store, REducer, Middleware, Action
advantage of react: works on virtual dom over real dome, server side rendering, unidirectional data flow and data binding, reusable components.
virtual dom: in memory representation of real dom.The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. 
It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. 
This entire process is called reconciliation.
